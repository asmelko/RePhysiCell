# Here we are creating two libraries:
# 1) PhysiCell-core: includes all core PhysiCell functionality
# 2) PhysiCell-core-no-addon: includes all core PhysiCell functionality, excluding the cell class
# The latter is necessary for projects that define ADDON_* macro for the specific intracellular support
